:addPath pathVar /B
::  Taken from StackOverflow answer http://stackoverflow.com/a/8046515/455535
::  Safely appends the path contained within variable pathVar to the end
::  of PATH if and only if the path does not already exist within PATH.
::
::  If the case insensitive /B option is specified, then the path is
::  inserted into the front (Beginning) of PATH instead.
::
::  If the pathVar path is fully qualified, then it is logically compared
::  to each fully qualified path within PATH. The path strings are
::  considered a match if they are logically equivalent.
::
::  If the pathVar path is relative, then it is strictly compared to each
::  relative path within PATH. Case differences and double quotes are
::  ignored, but otherwise the path strings must match exactly.
::
::  Before appending the pathVar path, all double quotes are stripped, and
::  then the path is enclosed in double quotes if and only if the path
::  contains at least one semicolon.
::
::  addPath aborts with ERRORLEVEL 2 if pathVar is missing or undefined
::  or if PATH is undefined.
