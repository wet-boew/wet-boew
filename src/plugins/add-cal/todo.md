Todo:

* Fully support time as defined by the `<time>` HTML element.
* Support event that only have multiple representation
*   Support for recurrence is limited. Only Google Calendar and iCal file support reccurence.
*   This feature should be implemented only if there is demand for it as it would be pretty complex for an author to specify.
