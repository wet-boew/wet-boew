<h2 class="margin-top-large"  id="print">Print versus Web</h2>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h3>Key points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Authors who do not optimize their content for online consumption risk creating a poor user experience that also hinders the readability of the information.</li>
    <li>Users have different behaviours and expectations of online content than they do for print content.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Content may end up online, but often it starts with an author opening up a print-based program, like Word.  As a result, the author may unknowingly create a product that is optimized for print, not Web.  This causes a fundamental problem as the two environments are extremely different from each other.</p>
<p>If you think of a book, there is an obvious start and stop point and the information is presented as text on paper, with the possibility of supporting images.  If you think of a movie, based on that same book, the paper is now a luminous environment that has no text, instead relying on moving imagery, colour and dialogue.  Although the core story may be the same, it's recognized that the mediums are very different and so to transition the content from paper to movie, a screenplay adaptation is done.</p>
<p>Similarly, a product that is created for print must then be adapted to be optimized for the Web.  Headings need to be reworked, layout needs to be changed, sentences need to be rewritten, etc.  Therefore, if the goal is to have the primary version of the content exist as a Web page, then the content should be written for the Web, not for print. This can often be difficult for authors to get used to but is a necessary skill to develop.  Content optimized for the Web ensures the information is easily discoverable by a user.</p>
<p>The article by Smashing Magazine, <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/31/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/">10 Principles Of Effective Web Design</a>, sums up user behaviour:</p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Since the visitor of the page is the only person who clicks the mouse and therefore decides everything, user-centric design has become a standard.</p>
  <p>Basically, users’ habits on the Web aren’t that different from customers’ habits in a store. Visitors glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. In fact, there are large parts of the page they don’t even look at.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>The Nielsen Norman Group wrote the article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/writing-style-for-print-vs-web/">Writing Style for Print vs. Web</a>. Their conclusion is: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p> In linear media — such as print and TV — people expect you to construct their experience for them. Readers are willing to follow the author's lead.</p>
  <p>In non-linear hypertext, the rules reverse. Users want to construct their own experience by piecing together content from multiple sources, emphasizing their desires in the current moment. People arrive at a website with a goal in mind, and they are ruthless in pursuing their own interest and in rejecting whatever the site is trying to push.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="development">Content development</h2>
<p>Developing content is the process of identifying the information that serves your users' needs and meets your goals. The process involves defining your users, identifying their tasks, and identifying the information they require to complete their tasks, while ensuring that the content also meets both your goals. </p>
<h3 id="users">Who are your users?</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Define your users.</li>
    <li>Focus on your primary users.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Many different users come to our websites; they may be individuals, business representatives, intermediaries and other professionals, media or youth, for example. Each type of user is different and needs different content. You must define each type of user so that you can provide the unique content that each needs. </p>
<p>You may, however, need to develop content to serve many different users. If that is the case, focus on your primary users or break your users into smaller groups with similar requirements. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="tasks">What are their tasks?</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Define the users’ tasks.</li>
    <li>Prioritize and sequence the tasks if there is more than one.</li>
    <li>Consider all possible tasks.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Users visit a website to complete their tasks. Define your users’ tasks and either prioritize them based on how frequently users perform them, or sequence them if they involve a series of smaller tasks. Your users may also want to complete many tasks in one visit, so you will need to consider how you can make it easy for them to do so. By defining your users’ tasks you will be able to understand their reasons for coming to your website, and you will be able to provide the content they need. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="need">What information do they need?</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Determine the content required to complete the tasks.</li>
    <li>Ensure the content is presented logically or sequentially.</li>
    <li>Ensure the content is timely and relevant.</li>
    <li>Ensure the content is not redundant or trivial. </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Once you have defined your users’ tasks, determine the information they will need to complete those tasks. The information must be specific to the tasks, and it must be presented logically or sequentially. The information must also be timely and relevant and not redundant or trivial.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="goals">What are your goals?</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish your goals for the content.</li>
    <li>Define how the content will meet your goals.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>As well as benefiting users, the content needs to serve your goals. To ensure that the content balances your business needs and the needs of your users, define your goals for the content and decide how the content will meet those goals.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="architecture">Content architecture</h2>
<p>Architecture is how the tasks and information about the tasks are organized, whether on one Web page or spread over dozens of pages. Organizing your content involves categorizing and arranging the tasks and information to suit your users’ needs and expectations. A good content architecture will help users quickly find what they are looking for.</p>
<h3 id="organize">Organize content</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Categorize your content.</li>
    <li>Prioritize your content.</li>
    <li>Keep the structure consistent.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>You can organize your content by audience, by topic, or by task, whichever best suits your users. But remember that each user is there to complete a task, so your categories should always lead to a task. However you organize your content, you need to keep the structure simple, logical, and consistent so users can quickly become familiar with it and be able to easily navigate through it. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="structure">Organize page structure</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>First – conclusion, summary, or task</li>
    <li>Second – supporting information</li>
    <li>Third – background and details</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>When organizing the content of a Web page, place the most important information at the top of the page where it can be found easily. The rest of the content should then follow in order of importance to your users. Start with the conclusion, summary, or task, followed by supporting information and, finally, background and details. It is also important to keep your page structure simple and consistent with your overall content structure. </p>
<p>Also refer to: <a href="layout-eng.html">Page length and scrolling</a></p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="alphabetization" class="margin-top-xlarge">Alphabetization</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Information is best organized by priority, importance, popularity, not alphabetical.</li>
    <li>Alphabetization works when the user knows the exact wording of all the options (cities, streets etc).</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Alphabetization of content is rarely a good idea.  It is successful when the information has a stable naming convention, like people's names, places etc.  However, all other information is best organized by priority, importance, popularity etc. </p>
  <p>If the user is not sure which alphabet letter their desire information would fall under, then their user experience is the same as if the content was in <strong>random order</strong>.</p>
<p>Usability expert, Jakob Nielsen, has numerous studies about how users behave. The article <a  href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/alpha-sorting.html">Alphabetical Sorting Must (Mostly) Die</a> states:</p>

<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Time lines and geographical location are other  groupings that are often useful. Finally, you can let the importance or  frequency of use guide how you prioritize long listings rather than  default to less-useful alphabetical sorting. </p>
  <p>Depending on the nature of your information, usability might be  better served by yet other types of structures. And yes, in a few  cases, this might even be the alphabet. But typically, when you reach  for an A-Z structure, you should give yourself a little extra kick and  seek out something better. </p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Usability expert, Jared Spool, has numerous studies about how users behave. The article <a  href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/01/20/determining-link-order-on-intranet-portals/">Determining Link Order on Intranet Portals</a> states: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Link order is also very important. Well-designed  portals put the most important links at the very top and order the  remaining links by priority and need. In our studies, poorly-designed  portals often resort to alphabetical order, which confuses employees as  they expect related links to be group together with the most critical  functions near the top.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Further, Jared Spool's article, <a  href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/02/06/alphabetized-links-are-random-links/">Alphabetized Links are Random Links</a>, states: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>(Alphabetical order is good) only if the users knew the  wording of the links. The exact wording. This works well for people's  names, states, cities, car models, and sports teams.</p>
  <p>Where it falls apart is for things where users may not know the  exact wording. In that instance, they must resort to the same behavior  they needed when we ordered the links based on the hat. They must scan  every link to make sure they can see what is relevant and what isn't. <strong>The moral of the story: Unless you can be absolutely sure that users  will know the exact terms in your list, alphabetical order is just  random order.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>

<h3 id="write">Write for content re-use</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Write each page as if it is the first page users will read.</li>
    <li>Create a separate page for common, supporting information as needed.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Site visitors do not access the same Web pages during every visit, nor do they access Web pages in the same order during every visit. For this reason, you should write each Web page without any assumptions as to what users have previously read or will subsequently read. Writing in this way means that each Web page is able to stand on its own.</p>
<p>In some instances, though, you will need to repeat phrases or sentences across many Web pages so that the information on each page is complete. However, if you find that you are repeating a lot of supporting content, you may want to create a new page for that content and link to it from the other pages. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="style">Content style and flow</h2>
<p>Users tend to scan Web pages when looking for information and typically read only 20% of the text. By using short, concise text that is easy to read and is focused on your users’ tasks, you will help them quickly find and use the content they need. </p>
<h3 id="plain">Plain language</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use common and familiar terms and phrases.</li>
    <li>Use the language of your audience.</li>
    <li>Avoid jargon.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Plain language principles focus on readers’ needs. To write in plain language, use familiar terms and phrases, include only one idea in each sentence, and keep paragraphs short and focused. In addition, use the language of your audience and not the internal language of your work. This means that you should avoid jargon and explain any technical terms. If you must use terms that are not familiar to your user, define them using common terms. </p>

<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-writing-use-search-keywords/">Use Old Words When Writing for Findability</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states: </p>
<blockquote  class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Many forces pressure Web writers to diminish a website's value by   filling it with words that are unlikely to appear in search queries.   Here are some guidelines for writing to ensure that users will find your   site: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Supplement made-up words with known words. </li>
    <li> Play down marketese and internal vocabulary. </li>
    <li> Supplement brand names with generic terms. </li>
    <li> Avoid "politically correct" terminology. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="scan" class="margin-top-xlarge">Scannable text</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Users scan, they don't read.</li>
    <li>Online content should be more concise than print content.</li>
    <li>Lists, sub-headings and short paragraphs improve the user's ability to scan.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Users are not reading online in the same way that they read a book.  Instead they are scanning the Web page.  By breaking up the content using lists, sub-headings and shortened paragraphs, it increases their ability to quickly assess the information.</p>
<p>In order adjust for this user behaviour and ensure a maximum uptake of information,  an author who writes for online consumption should have half the information presented than an author who writes for print. </p>

<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/">How Users Read on the Web</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states: </p>
<blockquote  class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p> People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, <strong> they  scan  the page </strong> , picking out individual words and sentences. In  research on how people read websites  we found that 79 percent of our test users always scanned any new page   they came across; only 16 percent read word-by-word. (Update: a newer   study found that  users read email newsletters even more abruptly than they read websites.) </p>
  <p> As a result, Web pages have to employ <strong> scannable text </strong> , using </p>
  <ul>
    <li> highlighted <strong> keywords </strong> (hypertext links serve as one form of highlighting; typeface variations and color are others) </li>
    <li> meaningful <strong> sub-headings </strong> (not "clever" ones) </li>
    <li> bulleted <strong> lists </strong> </li>
    <li><strong> one idea </strong> per paragraph (users will skip over any additional ideas if they are not caught by the first few words in the paragraph) </li>
    <li> the  inverted pyramid  style, starting with the conclusion </li>
    <li class="color-attention"><strong> half the word count </strong> (or less) than conventional writing </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/">How Little Do Users Read?</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states: </p>
<blockquote  class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>On the average Web page, users have time to read at most 28% of the words during an average visit; 20% is more likely.</p>
  <p> We've known since our first studies of how users read on the Web that they typically don't read very much. <strong> Scanning </strong> text is an extremely common behavior for higher-literacy users; our recent eyetracking studies further validate this finding. </p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="search">Searchability</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Determine users’ common search terms and phrases.</li>
    <li>Use those terms and phrases in the title, headings, text, and metadata.</li>
    <li>Avoid expressions, jargon, metaphors, and puns. </li>
    <li>Give each Web page a unique title.</li>
    <li>Include a clear page description in the metadata.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Search tools use the Web page’s title, headings, text, and metadata to generate search results based on users’ search terms. </p>
<p>The key to providing users with the search results they are looking for is to use common terms and phrases in the title, headings, text, and metadata that users are likely to use when they are searching for your content. It is good practice to identify those common search terms and phrases as you are developing the content and to use them often and consistently in the titles, headings, and text of your content, as well as in the page’s metadata. However, avoid using expressions, jargon, metaphors, puns, or any terms that cannot be taken literarily. </p>
<p>Many visitors use external search engines, such as Google. External search engines try to match users’ search terms with a Web page’s title, headings, and text. By including those search terms in your title, headings, and text, the search engine will be able to provide users with the content they are looking for.</p>
<p>To ensure there is no confusion when users are reviewing their search results, use a unique page title and include a page description in the metadata that provides a concise summary of the contents of the page. </p>

<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-writing-use-search-keywords/">Use Old Words When Writing for Findability</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states: </p>
<blockquote  class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Familiar words spring to mind when users create their search queries. If   your writing favors made-up terms over legacy words, users won't find   your site.</p>
  <p>"Speak the user's language" has been a primary usability guideline for   more than 20 years. The fact that the Web is a linguistic environment   further increases the importance of using the right vocabulary. </p>

<blockquote  class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Years ago, we were watching people try to find products on IKEA.com...Our initial stab had simple tasks. One of them was “Find a bookcase for your living room that can hold 200 books.”...every participant did exactly the same thing. They clicked in the search box on the IKEA home page and typed Bookcases. From here, it was pretty easy to get to the right product.</p>
  <p>In a second round of studies, we changed the task description to something more context-rich, avoiding any clues as to what to type in to the search engine. We ended up with:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You’ve just moved into a new place with a living room that you love because of its expansive walls. Now, you just need someplace to put those 200 prized books that you’ve had in boxes forever. How would you do that?&rdquo;  </p>

  <p>As we suspected, our participants’ behaviors changed. A couple folks typed bookcase into the search box. Others typed shelves, book shelves, book shelf, and one shelves for books. And others didn’t type anything into the search box, but clicked on the navigation links on the page, including storage systems. Most (but not all) found success using their own strategies.</p>

<h3 id="scent">Scent of information</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Users virutally sniff out the Web page in order to detemine which link to choose, in order to take them closer to the content they are seeking.</li>
	<li>A good scent of information can increases the chance of user success.  A poor scent impedes the user, causing dissatisfaction.</li>
    <li>Navigation, descriptive links, graphics and layout prioritization can improve the scent of information</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Users are on hunt.  They arrive on a Web page, scan the content and then determine if this is their destination page. If they decide that their desired content is not there, they hopefully want to continue the hunt and typically use links to make another page selection.  How do they choose the next link?  Well, they are virtually sniffing out which link has the strongest scent.  This principal is known as scent of information.</p>
<p>With this user behaviour in mind, it becomes obvious why it is crucial to always have descriptive link text.  Vague, poorly named, obscure or incomplete links will decrease the scent and therefore increase the user dissatisfacation causing them to abondon their hunt. </p>
<p>In addition to links, the scent of information is achieved with navigation, graphics and layout prioritization.  These pulls the user to the content.  This is different from a site's architecture, which pushes the user to the content.</p>

<p>Xerox researchers, Peter Pirolli and Wai Tat-Fu, developed the information foraging theory: <a href="http://www2.parc.com/istl/groups/uir/publications/items/UIR-2003-02-Pirolli-UM-SNIFACT.pdf">SNIF-ACT: A Model of Information Foraging on the World Wide Web (239 KB, PDF)</a>.  This is the precursor to the scent of information.  Their report states: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>(1) users working on unfamiliar tasks are expected to choose links that have high information scent, (2) users will leave a site when the information scent of the site diminishes below a certain threshold</p>

    <li>Decorating content can increase or decrease its credibility.</li>
    <li>Content that is deemed aesthetically pleasing is deemed to be more usable.</li>
    <li>Users form an opinion in 1/20th about about what they see.</li>
    <li>It's hard to change a user's opinion so it's best to get it right the first time.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Content authors must also value the presentation of the information they have created, as the aesthetics affect the usability and credibility of the content.  The decoration that supports the content must be visually pleasing and appropriate.  If a user deems the presentation to be weak or inappropriate, they lose trust. </p>
<p>Of course the   most important part of a Web page. A visually attractive site is of no   value to users if they cannot locate the information they need.</p>

<h4>The 1/20th of a second opinion</h4>
<p>Research shows that users form an opinion of a site within 1/20th of a second. An article on the BBC Web site titled <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4616700.stm" target="_blank">First impressions count for Web (external link)</a>, states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The researchers also believe that these quickly formed first   impressions last because of what is known to psychologists as the "halo   effect". If people believe a Web site looks good, then this positive   quality will spread to other areas, such as the Web   site's content. Since people like to be right, they will continue to   use the Web site that made a good first impression, as this will further   confirm that their initial decision was a good one."</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Aesthetics and the user experience</h4>
<p>An article on the popular site A List Apart, titled <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/indefenseofeyecandy/" target="_blank"> In defense of eye candy</a>, explores the value of   design and how the presentation layer affects the user's experience and   the affects the site's credibility. It states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"According to a <a href="http://www.consumerwebwatch.org/news/report3_credibilityresearch/stanfordPTL.pdf" target="_blank"> 2002 study: How Do People Evaluate a Web Site's Credibility? (PDF, 1.2 MB)</a>,   the &ldquo;appeal of the overall visual design of a site, including layout,   typography, font size, and colour schemes,&rdquo; is the number one factor we   use to evaluate a Web   site's credibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more we learn about people, and how our brains process   information, the more we learn the truth of that phrase: form and   function aren't separate items. If we believe that style somehow exists   independent of functionality, that we can treat aesthetics   and function as two separate pieces, then we ignore the evidence that   beauty is much more than decoration. Our brains can't help but agree."</p>
<h4>Aesthetics and usability</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>A article from the University of Washington titled <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/art479/media/universal_principles1.pdf" target="_blank"> Aesthetic-Usability Effect (PDF, 1.4 MB)</a>, discusses   how individuals think aesthetically pleasing Web site designs are easier   to use than site designs that are less pleasing. This is known as the <strong>aesthetic-usability effect</strong>. The article states:</p>
  <p>"Aesthetic designs are more effective at fostering positive design   attitude than unaesthetic design, and make people more tolerant of   design problems &hellip; Such personal and positive relationships with a design   evoke feelings of affection, loyalty, and patience   &mdash; all significant factors in the long-term usability and overall   success of a design."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proper usability testing is still recommended. Aesthetics do not   replace or equate to usability. Aesthetics simply enhance and compliment   usability. </p>
<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="content">Content structure</h2>
<p>You   can organize your content by audience, by topic, or by task, whichever   best suits your users. But remember that each user is there to complete a   task, so   your categories should always lead to a task. However you organize your   content, you need to keep the structure simple, logical, and consistent   so users can quickly become familiar with it and be able to easily   navigate through it.</p>
<p>Below are some techniques that help with this concept.</p>
<h3 id="heading">Headings</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> Give each Web page a unique, descriptive title.</li>
    <li> Use clear, concise, descriptive, and familiar terms or phrases. </li>
    <li> Use headings to break up long Web pages.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>The   first thing users see on a Web page is the title, so the title must   instantly convey the type of content the page contains. The page title   must also be   unique so users will not confuse one page with another. Headings must   also be clear and descriptive to help guide users to the content they   are looking for. Headings are also used to break up large blocks of text.</p>

<p>Some heading basics are:</p>
<p> In the article, <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/12/website-usability-tips/">7 Best Practices for Improving Your Website's Usability</a> on mashable.com, proper headings usage is discussed: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>...when we look at a webpage, we tend to see it not as a whole, but rather   as compartmentalized chunks of information. We tend to read in blocks,   going directly to items that seem to match what we're actively looking   for.</p>
  <p>An eye-tracking study conducted by Nielsen revealed an eye-movement   pattern that could further support this idea that web users do indeed   read in chunks: We swipe our eyes from left to right, then continue on   down the page in an F-shaped pattern, skipping a lot of text in between.</p>
  <p>We can do several things to accommodate these reading patterns. One   strategy is to break up long articles into sections so that users can   easily skim down the page. This applies to block reading (because blocks   of text are denoted by headings) as well as the F-shaped pattern,   because we're attracted to the headings as we move down the page.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>So not only is it a good writing practice to use sub-headings on longer documents, but when that information is on the Web, sub-headings  improve the usability and readability as well.</p>
<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/worlds-best-headlines-bbc-news/">World's Best Headlines: BBC News </a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states that successful headings must be: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <ul>
    <li> <strong> short </strong> (because people  don't read much online); </li>
    <li> <strong> rich in information scent </strong> , clearly summarizing the target article; </li>
    <li> <strong> front-loaded </strong> with the most important keywords (because users often  scan only the beginning of list items); </li>
    <li> <strong> understandable out of context </strong> (because headlines often appear without articles, as in search engine results); and </li>
    <li> <strong> predictable </strong> , so users know whether they'll like the full article <em> before </em> they click (because people don't return to sites that promise more than they deliver).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Furthermore, the  article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-2-words-a-signal-for-scanning/"> First 2 Words: A Signal for the Scanning Eye</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group,  states: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Users typically <strong> see about 2 words </strong> for most list items; they'll see a little more if the lead words are short, and only the first word if they're long.</p>
  <p>Best...</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Use plain language </li>
    <li> Use specific terminology </li>
    <li> Follow conventions for naming common features </li>
    <li> Front-load user- and action-oriented terms </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Worst...</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Bland, generic words </li>
    <li> Made-up words or terms </li>
    <li> Starting with blah-blah and deferring the information-carrying text to the end </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>With the above information in mind, a real life example is is provided in the article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/writing-style-for-print-vs-web/">Writing Style for Print vs. Web</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group.  This article highlights the differing approaches to a print heading and a Web heading: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p> I recently read an article in       The New York Times      about tall people's travails on the road: "Coping With the Tall Traveler's Curse." The <strong> headline </strong> itself is actually an example of the differences between print and online content style: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> In print, a phrase like "tall traveler's curse" is a bit enticing and   might draw readers in. Because the article featured a photo of a tall   guy crunched in the back of a taxi, the article's content was clear to   anybody glancing at that page in the newspaper. </li>
    <li> In contrast, putting the same headline online would fail several  guidelines for writing for the Web :
      <ul>
        <li> The first 3 words have <strong> no information-carrying content </strong> . On the Web, you must start with words like "tall traveler" because users often  scan down the left part of a list of items. They never see the last words in a link unless the first few words attract their attention. </li>
        <li> The headline <strong> lacks keywords </strong> &mdash; such as "airline seat" and "hotel bed" &mdash; that are important for   search engine optimization (SEO). No one will search "curse" when trying   to find out which hotel chains offer extra-long beds or which airline   seats are the least unpleasant for long-legged travelers. </li>
        <li> The words "tall traveler's curse" are <strong> insufficiently specific </strong> to tell users what the story is about. Because headlines are often   presented as plain links removed from the article itself, the photo of   the poor guy in the cab won't be there to explain the story's content.   Online, the headline alone must provide enough  information scent to let users predict what they'll get if they follow the link. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Give the list a descriptive and unique title.</li>
    <li>Try to avoid sub-lists. </li>
    <li>Arrange the list in a logical order.</li>
    <li>Use numbers when listing steps or instructions and bullets for all other lists. </li>
    <li>List the elements with a parallel structure.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Lists are easier to scan than paragraphs, so, where appropriate, use lists instead of paragraphs. However, sub-lists can be confusing and sometimes difficult to scan, so avoid them as much as you can. Each list should have a descriptive and unique heading or an introductory sentence or paragraph to provide some context.</p>
<p>Arrange the items of a list in a logical or sequential order. If you are listing a series of items where the order is important, you should use numbers rather than bullets. Furthermore, list items with a <a href="#parallel">parallel structure</a> helps users scan lists more quickly. </p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the title of the target page as the title of the hyperlink, or as close as possible.</li>
    <li>Only add a hyperlink to the first reference.</li>
    <li>Avoid embedding too many hyperlinks in one paragraph.</li>
    <li>Limit hyperlinks to important information. </li>
    <li>Verify that the hyperlinks work.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Hyperlinks take from the user from one Web page to another.  They can be used to avoid repeating information that is already clearly expressed on another Web page. They can also be used to reference related information, such as definitions, supporting information, and background information.</p>
<p>Use the title of the target page as the text in the hyperlink; it’s very confusing to users if they don’t match.  However, sometimes there is a need to modify the text, so in those cases attempt to match it as closely as possible. If you refer to another Web page more than once, only add a hyperlink to the first reference. Also, avoid embedding too many hyperlinks in any one paragraph because they can be confusing if they are too close together; users may not be able to tell where one hyperlink ends and the next one begins. </p>
<p>You may be tempted to add a hyperlink to any reference, but you should only add a hyperlink to references that will help users complete their task or that provide valuable information about the task. You should not add a hyperlink to unnecessary or unrelated information because too much blue, underlined text is distracting and because it becomes difficult for users to distinguish between important and unimportant hyperlinks. </p>
<p>Finally, ensure that the hyperlinks direct users to the right page. </p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="#scent">Scent of information</a> for more on hyperlinks.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="image">Images</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Images must support content, not decorate it.</li>
    <li>Images have a cognitive load on the user so use them wisely.</li>
    <li>Users regularly ignore images.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Images are great, but only when they add value to the user experience.  Images must be professional looking, modern, not blurry or pixelated and also be relevant to the content they support.  That said, users will ignore them almost half the time. </p>
<p>Images are not free, as they introduce a cognitive load on the user.  This means and for every unnecessary image, the user has had to visually navigate around it or acknowledge it.  There is a cost for this, as the user is no longer focused soley on the information.  Therefore, choose your images wisely.</p>

<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/photos-as-web-content/">Photos as Web Content </a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states that: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Users pay close attention to photos and other images that contain   relevant information but ignore fluffy pictures used to "jazz up" Web   pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>In the comprehensive <strong>3 page</strong> article, <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1412019">Eyetracking Web Usability: Images</a>, by Jakob Nielsen and Kara Pernice, image use is discussed in detail. The entire article is a recommended read but here are some highlights:</p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Good images explain a concept, conjure a feeling, convey information,   and enhance people's overall experience on a site. Bad images waste   space, are ignored by users, and, even worse, are confusing.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p> Depending on the context and types of images,   people look at less than half of the images presented to them on   average&mdash;only 42 percent. And in general, they look at those images for   less than two-tenths of a second. People ignore more images than they look at on the Web, and they look at images for just a fraction of a second.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Designers should beware of using images that accompany text but don't do   anything to enhance it. We believe that these images should not be on a   page. They are a waste of pixels, of the designer's work, and of users'   time.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Users look at images that are related to content about twice as often&mdash;29 percent of the time. </p>
</blockquote>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure that all columns and rows have a heading.</li>
    <li>Use tables for financial, statistical, comparative, or numerical information only.</li>
    <li>Keep tables short, clear, and concise.</li>
    <li>Ensure that there is enough white space around each data element. </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Tables can be an effective way of presenting information; however, they should only be used to display financial, statistical, comparative, or numerical information–—not to serve stylistic purposes. Like text, tables should be clear and concise, with as few data elements as possible in each cell. If you need to include more than a few words in any cell, consider using another format.</p>
<p>If there is not enough white space in each cell, the data becomes difficult to read. Ensure that each row and column has a clear and concise heading; this allows screen readers to unambiguously convey the content of the tables. Consider using a visual cue such as <a href="../zebra/simple.html">zebra striping</a> to distinguish each row from the next. </p>
