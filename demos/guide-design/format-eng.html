<h2 class="margin-top-large"  id="print">Print versus Web</h2>
<p>Content may end up online, but often it starts with an author opening up a print-based program, like Word.  As a result, the author may unknowingly create a product that is optimized for print, not Web.  This causes a fundamental problem as the two environments are extremely different from each other.</p>
<p>If you think of a book, there is an obvious start and stop point and the information is presented as text on paper, with the possibility of supporting images.  If you think of a movie, based on that same book, the paper is now a luminous environment that has no text, instead relying on moving imagery, colour and dialogue.  Although the core story may be the same, it's recognized that the mediums are very different and so to transition the content from paper to movie, a screenplay adaptation is done.</p>
<p>Similarly, a product that is created for print must then be adapted to be optimized for the Web.  Headings need to be reworked, layout needs to be changed, sentences need to be rewritten, etc.  Therefore, if the goal is to have the primary version of the content exist as a Web page, then the content should be written for the Web, not for print. This can often be difficult for authors to get used to but is a necessary skill to develop.  Content optimized for the Web ensures the information is easily discoverable by a user.</p>
<h3 id="user">User behaviour</h3>
<p>The article by Smashing Magazine, <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/31/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/">10 Principles Of Effective Web Design</a>, sums up user behaviour:</p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Since the visitor of the page is the only person who clicks the mouse and therefore decides everything, user-centric design has become a standard.</p>
  <p>Basically, users’ habits on the Web aren’t that different from customers’ habits in a store. Visitors glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. In fact, there are large parts of the page they don’t even look at.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Nielsen Norman Group wrote the article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/writing-style-for-print-vs-web/">Writing Style for Print vs. Web</a>. Their conclusion is: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p> In linear media — such as print and TV — people expect you to construct their experience for them. Readers are willing to follow the author's lead.</p>
  <p>In non-linear hypertext, the rules reverse. Users want to construct their own experience by piecing together content from multiple sources, emphasizing their desires in the current moment. People arrive at a website with a goal in mind, and they are ruthless in pursuing their own interest and in rejecting whatever the site is trying to push.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="content">Content structure</h2>
<p>You   can organize your content by audience, by topic, or by task, whichever   best suits your users. But remember that each user is there to complete a   task, so   your categories should always lead to a task. However you organize your   content, you need to keep the structure simple, logical, and consistent   so users can quickly become familiar with it and be able to easily   navigate through it.</p>
<p>Below are some techniques that help with this concept.</p>
<h3 id="plain">Plain language</h3>
<p>To write in plain language, use familiar terms and phrases, include only one idea in each sentence, and keep   paragraphs short and focused. </p>
<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-writing-use-search-keywords/">Use Old Words When Writing for Findability</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states: </p>
<blockquote  class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Familiar words spring to mind when users create their search queries. If   your writing favors made-up terms over legacy words, users won't find   your site.</p>
  <p>"Speak the user's language" has been a primary usability guideline for   more than 20 years. The fact that the Web is a linguistic environment   further increases the importance of using the right vocabulary. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote  class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Many forces pressure Web writers to diminish a website's value by   filling it with words that are unlikely to appear in search queries.   Here are some guidelines for writing to ensure that users will find your   site: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Supplement made-up words with known words. </li>
    <li> Play down marketese and internal vocabulary. </li>
    <li> Supplement brand names with generic terms. </li>
    <li> Avoid "politically correct" terminology. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scan" class="margin-top-xlarge">Scannable text</h3>
<p>Users   tend to scan Web pages when looking for information. By using short, concise text that is easy to read and   is focused   on your users' tasks, you will help them quickly find and use the   content they need.</p>
<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/">How Users Read on the Web</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states: </p>
<blockquote  class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p> People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, <strong> they  scan &nbsp;the page </strong> , picking out individual words and sentences. In  research on how people read websites &nbsp;we found that 79 percent of our test users always scanned any new page   they came across; only 16 percent read word-by-word. (Update: a newer   study found that  users read email newsletters even more abruptly than they read websites.) </p>
  <p> As a result, Web pages have to employ <strong> scannable text </strong> , using </p>
  <ul>
    <li> highlighted <strong> keywords </strong> (hypertext links serve as one form of highlighting; typeface variations and color are others) </li>
    <li> meaningful <strong> sub-headings </strong> (not "clever" ones) </li>
    <li> bulleted <strong> lists </strong> </li>
    <li><strong> one idea </strong> per paragraph (users will skip over any additional ideas if they are not caught by the first few words in the paragraph) </li>
    <li> the  inverted pyramid &nbsp;style, starting with the conclusion </li>
    <li class="color-attention"><strong> half the word count </strong> (or less) than conventional writing </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/">How Little Do Users Read?</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states: </p>
<blockquote  class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>On the average Web page, users have time to read at most 28% of the words during an average visit; 20% is more likely.</p>
  <p> We've known since our first studies of how users read on the Web that they typically don't read very much. <strong> Scanning </strong> text is an extremely common behavior for higher-literacy users; our recent eyetracking studies further validate this finding. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="alphabetization" class="margin-top-xlarge">Alphabetization</h3>
<p>Alphabetization of content is rarely a good idea.  There are situations where it is successful and others where it is not, as outlined below.</p>
<p>Usability expert, Jakob Nielsen, has numerous studies about how users behave. The article <a  href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/alpha-sorting.html">Alphabetical Sorting Must (Mostly) Die</a> states </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Time lines and geographical location are other  groupings that are often useful. Finally, you can let the importance or  frequency of use guide how you prioritize long listings rather than  default to less-useful alphabetical sorting. </p>
  <p>Depending on the nature of your information, usability might be  better served by yet other types of structures. And yes, in a few  cases, this might even be the alphabet. But typically, when you reach  for an A&ndash;Z structure, you should give yourself a little extra kick and  seek out something better. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usability expert, Jared Spool, has numerous studies about how users behave. The article <a  href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/01/20/determining-link-order-on-intranet-portals/">Determining Link Order on Intranet Portals</a> states: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Link order is also very important. Well-designed  portals put the most important links at the very top and order the  remaining links by priority and need. In our studies, poorly-designed  portals often resort to alphabetical order, which confuses employees as  they expect related links to be group together with the most critical  functions near the top.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, Jaren Spool's article, <a  href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/02/06/alphabetized-links-are-random-links/">Alphabetized Links are Random Links</a>, states: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>(Alphabetical order is good) only if the users knew the  wording of the links. The exact wording. This works well for people&rsquo;s  names, states, cities, car models, and sports teams.</p>
  <p>Where it falls apart is for things where users may not know the  exact wording. In that instance, they must resort to the same behavior  they needed when we ordered the links based on the hat. They must scan  every link to make sure they can see what is relevant and what isn&rsquo;t.  The moral of the story: Unless you can be absolutely sure that users  will know the exact terms in your list, alphabetical order is just  random order. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="heading">Heading structure</h2>
<p>The   first thing users see on a Web page is the title, so the title must   instantly convey the type of content the page contains. The page title   must also be   unique so users will not confuse one page with another. Headings must   also be clear and descriptive to help guide users to the content they   are looking for. Headings are also used to break up large blocks of text.</p>
<p>Some heading basic are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Give each Web page a unique, descriptive title.</li>
  <li> Use clear, concise, descriptive, and familiar terms or phrases. </li>
  <li> Use headings to break up long Web pages.</li>
</ul>
<p> In the article, <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/12/website-usability-tips/">7 Best Practices for Improving Your Website's Usability</a> on mashable.com, proper headings usage is discussed: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>...when we look at a webpage, we tend to see it not as a whole, but rather   as compartmentalized chunks of information. We tend to read in blocks,   going directly to items that seem to match what we're actively looking   for.</p>
  <p>An eye-tracking study conducted by Nielsen revealed an eye-movement   pattern that could further support this idea that web users do indeed   read in chunks: We swipe our eyes from left to right, then continue on   down the page in an F-shaped pattern, skipping a lot of text in between.</p>
  <p>We can do several things to accommodate these reading patterns. One   strategy is to break up long articles into sections so that users can   easily skim down the page. This applies to block reading (because blocks   of text are denoted by headings) as well as the F-shaped pattern,   because we're attracted to the headings as we move down the page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So not only is it a good writing practice to use sub-headings on longer documents, but when that information is on the Web, sub-headings  improve the usability and readability as well.</p>
<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/worlds-best-headlines-bbc-news/">World's Best Headlines: BBC News </a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states that successful headings must be: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <ul>
    <li> <strong> short </strong> (because people  don't read much online); </li>
    <li> <strong> rich in information scent </strong> , clearly summarizing the target article; </li>
    <li> <strong> front-loaded </strong> with the most important keywords (because users often  scan only the beginning of list items); </li>
    <li> <strong> understandable out of context </strong> (because headlines often appear without articles, as in search engine results); and </li>
    <li> <strong> predictable </strong> , so users know whether they'll like the full article <em> before </em> they click (because people don't return to sites that promise more than they deliver).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the  article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-2-words-a-signal-for-scanning/"> First 2 Words: A Signal for the Scanning Eye</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group,  states: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Users typically <strong> see about 2 words </strong> for most list items; they'll see a little more if the lead words are short, and only the first word if they're long.</p>
  <p>Best...</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Use plain language </li>
    <li> Use specific terminology </li>
    <li> Follow conventions for naming common features </li>
    <li> Front-load user- and action-oriented terms </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Worst...</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Bland, generic words </li>
    <li> Made-up words or terms </li>
    <li> Starting with blah-blah and deferring the information-carrying text to the end </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the above information in mind, a real life example is is provided in the article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/writing-style-for-print-vs-web/">Writing Style for Print vs. Web</a> by the Nielsen Norman Group.  This article highlights the differing approaches to a print heading and a Web heading: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p> I recently read an article in       The New York Times      about tall people's travails on the road: "  Coping With the Tall Traveler's Curse ." The <strong> headline </strong> itself is actually an example of the differences between print and online content style: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> In print, a phrase like "tall traveler's curse" is a bit enticing and   might draw readers in. Because the article featured a photo of a tall   guy crunched in the back of a taxi, the article's content was clear to   anybody glancing at that page in the newspaper. </li>
    <li> In contrast, putting the same headline online would fail several  guidelines for writing for the Web :
      <ul>
        <li> The first 3 words have <strong> no information-carrying content </strong> . On the Web, you must start with words like "tall traveler" because users often  scan down the left part of a list of items. They never see the last words in a link unless the first few words attract their attention. </li>
        <li> The headline <strong> lacks keywords </strong> &mdash; such as "airline seat" and "hotel bed" &mdash; that are important for   search engine optimization (SEO). No one will search "curse" when trying   to find out which hotel chains offer extra-long beds or which airline   seats are the least unpleasant for long-legged travelers. </li>
        <li> The words "tall traveler's curse" are <strong> insufficiently specific </strong> to tell users what the story is about. Because headlines are often   presented as plain links removed from the article itself, the photo of   the poor guy in the cab won't be there to explain the story's content.   Online, the headline alone must provide enough  information scent to let users predict what they'll get if they follow the link. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="image">Use of images</h2>
<p>Images are great, but only when they add value to the user experience.  Images must be good quality and relevant to the content they support.  Yet even then, users will ignore them almost half the time. </p>
<p>The article, <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/photos-as-web-content/">Photos as Web Content </a> by the Nielsen Norman Group, states that: </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Users pay close attention to photos and other images that contain   relevant information but ignore fluffy pictures used to "jazz up" Web   pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the comprehensive <strong>3 page</strong> article, <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1412019">Eyetracking Web Usability: Images</a>, by Jakob Nielsen and Kara Pernice, image use is discussed in detail. The entire article is a recommended read but here are some highlights:</p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Good images explain a concept, conjure a feeling, convey information,   and enhance people&rsquo;s overall experience on a site. Bad images waste   space, are ignored by users, and, even worse, are confusing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p> Depending on the context and types of images,   people look at less than half of the images presented to them on   average&mdash;only 42 percent. And in general, they look at those images for   less than two-tenths of a second. People ignore more images than they look at on the Web, and they look at images for just a fraction of a second.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Designers should beware of using images that accompany text but don&rsquo;t do   anything to enhance it. We believe that these images should not be on a   page. They are a waste of pixels, of the designer&rsquo;s work, and of users&rsquo;   time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large">
  <p>Users look at images that are related to content about twice as often&mdash;29 percent of the time. </p>
