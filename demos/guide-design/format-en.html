  <p>Users approach online content very differently than they do print material—they are on a hunt. They are actively searching for information rather than passively accepting the information as it is presented. When users arrive on a Web page they quickly scan the information to see if they have found what they are looking for. If they don’t see it immediately, they move on—they are following the scent (or trace) of information. Users also tend to scan online text looking for keywords and familiar phrases rather than reading each word.</p>
  <p>To reach users, you need to write information so that users can quickly scan and find what they are looking for. As well, you will need to rewrite content that was originally intended for a print audience to suit a Web audience.</p>

<h2 class="margin-top-large"  id="print">Print versus Web</h2>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h3>Key points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Authors who write their content specifically for the Web create a positive user experience, which helps readability</li>
    <li>Users approach online content and print content with different expectations and behaviours</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Content may end up online, but it often starts with an author opening up a print-based program, like MS Word. As a result, the author may unknowingly create a product that is best suited for print, not the Web. This causes a fundamental problem as the two environments are extremely different from each other.</p>
<p>If you think of a book, there is an obvious start and stop point, and the information is presented as text on paper, with the possibility of supporting images. If you think of a movie based on that same book, the paper becomes a luminous environment that has no text, relying instead on moving imagery, colour, and dialogue. Although the core story may be the same, the mediums are very different, and a screenplay adapts the content from paper to a film.</p>
<p>Similarly, a product that is created for print must be adapted to work well on the Web. Headings should be reworked, the layout needs to be changed, and the text rewritten. If the goal is to have the primary version of the content exist as a Web page, then the content should be written for the Web, not for print. This can be difficult for print authors to get used to, but it is a necessary skill to develop. Content created for the Web ensures the information is easy for the user to discover.</p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large float-right width-90">
  <p>Since the visitor of the page is the only person who clicks the mouse and therefore decides everything, user-centric design has become a standard.</p>
  <p>Basically, users’ habits on the Web aren’t that different from customers’ habits in a store. Visitors glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they’re looking for. In fact, there are large parts of the page they don’t even look at.</p>

<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="development">Content development</h2>
<p>Developing content is the process of identifying the information that serves your users' needs and meets your organizational goals. The process involves defining your users, identifying their tasks, and identifying the information they require to complete their tasks, while ensuring that the content also meets your organizational goals.</p>
<h3 id="users">Who are your users?</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Define your users</li>
    <li>Focus on your primary users</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Many different users may come to your Web site; they may be individuals, business representatives, intermediaries and other professionals, media or youth. Each type of user is different and needs different content. You must define each type of user so that you can provide the unique information that each needs.</p>
<p>You may, however, need to develop content to serve many different users. If that is the case, focus on your primary users or break your users into smaller groups with similar requirements.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="tasks">What are their tasks?</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Define the users’ tasks</li>
    <li>Order and sequence the tasks if there are more than one</li>
    <li>Consider all possible tasks</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Users visit a Web site to complete their tasks. Define your users’ tasks and either prioritize them based on how frequently users perform them or sequence them if they involve a series of smaller tasks. Your users may also want to complete many tasks in one visit, so you will need to consider how you can make it easy for them to do so. By defining your users’ tasks you will be able to understand their reasons for coming to your Web site, and you will be able to provide the information they need.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="need">What information do they need?</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Determine the content required to complete the tasks</li>
    <li>Ensure the content is presented logically or sequentially</li>
    <li>Ensure the content is timely and relevant</li>
    <li>Ensure the content is not redundant or trivial</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Once you have defined your users’ tasks, determine the information they will need to complete those tasks. The information must be specific to the tasks, and it must be presented logically or sequentially. The information must also be timely and relevant and not redundant or trivial.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="goals">What are your goals?</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Establish your goals for the content</li>
    <li>Define how the content will meet your goals</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>As well as benefiting users, the Web site needs to serve your organization’s goals. To ensure that the content balances your business needs and your users’ needs, define your goals for the site and decide how the content will meet those goals.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="architecture">Content architecture</h2>
<p>Content architecture is how the tasks and information about those tasks are organized, whether on one Web page or spread over dozens of pages. Organizing your content involves categorizing and arranging the tasks and information to suit your users’ needs and expectations. A good content architecture will help users quickly find what they are looking for.</p>
<h3 id="organize">Organize your content</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Categorize your content</li>
    <li>Prioritize your content</li>
    <li>Keep the structure consistent</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>You can organize your content by audience, topic, or task, whichever best suits your users. But remember that each user is there to complete a task, so your categories should always lead to a task. Some tasks may be more popular than others, so be sure to organize your content so that the most popular tasks are the easiest to find. However you organize your content, you need to keep the structure simple, logical, and consistent so users can quickly become familiar with it and able to navigate easily through it.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="structure">Organize your page structure</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>First – conclusion, summary, or task</li>
    <li>Second – supporting information</li>
    <li>Third – background and details</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>When organizing the information on a Web page, place the most important information at the top of the page where it can be found easily. The rest of the information should then follow in order of importance to your users. Start with the conclusion, summary, or task, followed by supporting information and, finally, background and details. It is also important to keep your page structure simple and consistent with your overall content structure. See, also, <a href="layout-en.html#scrolling">Page length and scrolling</a></p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="alphabetization" class="margin-top-xlarge">Alphabetization</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>    Information is best organized by priority, importance, popularity, not alphabetical order</li>
    <li>Alphabetizing works when the user knows the exact wording of all the options </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Alphabetizing content is rarely a good idea. It is successful when the information has stable naming conventions, like people's names, or geographical locations. However, all other information is best organized by priority, importance, or popularity. </p>
<p>If the user is unsure which letter their desired information would fall under, then his or her experience of your content is the same as it were in <strong>random order</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large float-right width-90">
  <p>...you can let the importance or  frequency of use guide how you prioritize long listings rather than  default to less-useful alphabetical sorting...But typically, when you reach  for an A-Z structure, you should give yourself a little extra kick and  seek out something better. </p>

  <p>(Alphabetical order is good) only if the users knew the  wording of the links. The exact wording. This works well for people's  names, states, cities, car models, and sports teams.</p>
  <p>Where it falls apart is for things where users may not know the  exact wording. In that instance...they must scan  every link to make sure they can see what is relevant and what isn't. <strong>The moral of the story: Unless you can be absolutely sure that users  will know the exact terms in your list, alphabetical order is just  random order.</strong> </p>

<h3 id="write">Write in complete blocks</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Write each page as if it were the first page users will read</li>
    <li>Create a separate page for common and supporting information as needed</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Site visitors do not access the same Web pages during every visit, nor do they access them in the same order during every visit. For this reason, you should write each Web page without any assumptions as to what users have previously read or will subsequently read. Writing in this way means that each Web page is able to stand on its own.</p>
<p>In some instances, you will need to repeat phrases or sentences across many Web pages so that the information on each page is complete. However, if you find that you are repeating a lot of supporting content, you may want to create a new page for that information and link to it from the other pages. </p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large float-right width-90">
  <p>When we look at a webpage, we tend to see it not as a whole, but rather   as compartmentalized chunks of information. We tend to read in blocks,   going directly to items that seem to match what we're actively looking   for.</p>
  <p>An eye-tracking study conducted by Nielsen revealed an eye-movement   pattern that could further support this idea that web users do indeed   read in chunks: We swipe our eyes from left to right, then continue on   down the page in an F-shaped pattern, skipping a lot of text in between.</p>
  <p>We can do several things to accommodate these reading patterns. One   strategy is to break up long articles into sections so that users can   easily skim down the page. This applies to block reading (because blocks   of text are denoted by headings) as well as the F-shaped pattern,   because we're attracted to the headings as we move down the page.</p>

<p>Users tend to scan Web pages when looking for information and typically read only 20% of the text. By using short, concise text that is easy to read and is focused on your users’ tasks you will help them quickly find and use the information they need.</p>
<h3 id="plain">Use plain language</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Use common and familiar terms and phrases</li>
    <li>Use the language of your audience</li>
    <li>Avoid jargon</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Writing in plain language means you are using the language of your audience. To write in plain language, use familiar terms and phrases, include only one idea in each sentence, and keep paragraphs short and focused. Do not use the internal language of your organization and avoid jargon and overly technical terms. If you must use terms that are not familiar to your user, define them using common terms.</p>

<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Users scan text rather than read each word</li>
    <li>Online content should be more concise than print content</li>
    <li>Lists, subheadings, and short paragraphs improve users’ ability to scan</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Users are not reading online in the same way that they read a book. Instead they are scanning the Web page. Breaking up the content with lists, subheadings and shorter paragraphs increases their ability to assess information quickly.</p>
<p>To adjust for this user behaviour and ensure maximum uptake of information, an author who writes for online audiences should offer the same information in about half the space compared to one who writes for print.</p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large float-right width-90">
  <p>People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, <strong> they  scan  the page </strong>, picking out individual words and sentences. In  research on how people read websites  we found that 79 percent of our test users always scanned any new page   they came across; only 16 percent read word-by-word. </p>
  <p>On the average Web page, users have time to read at most 28% of the words during an average visit; 20% is more likely.</p>
  <p> We've known since our first studies of how users read on the Web that they typically don't read very much. <strong> Scanning </strong> text is an extremely common behavior for higher-literacy users; our recent eyetracking studies further validate this finding.</p>

<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
	<li>Users are on a hunt for information</li>
    <li>A good scent of information can help users find it</li>
    <li>Descriptive links, graphics, and layout can improve the scent of information</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Users are hunting for information. They arrive on a Web page and scan the content looking for information. If they can’t see what they are looking for, they continue their hunt by following a link to another page.  How do they choose the next link? They are virtually sniffing out which link has the strongest scent. This practice is known as following the scent of information.</p>
<p>With this user behaviour in mind, it becomes obvious why it is crucial to always use descriptive links. Vague, poorly named, obscure, or incomplete links will decrease the scent and frustrate users, perhaps causing them to abandon their hunt. In addition to descriptive links, users pick up the scent of information from graphics and the layout. </p>
<p>Xerox researchers, Peter Pirolli and Wai Tat-Fu, developed the information foraging theory, which is the precursor to the scent of information theory.</p>

<p>Professionally written material pays close attention to the details. Ensure that your content is focused on your audience and is clear, concise, consistent, and grammatically correct.

</div>
<p>Many users turn to a Web site’s search tool to find the information they are looking for. Search tools try to match the users’ search terms to a Web page by comparing the search terms to page titles, headings, text, and metadata. The search tool then displays the Web pages that most closely match the search terms.</p>
<p>The key to providing users with the search results they are looking for is to use the terms and phrases in the title, headings, text, and metadata that users are likely to use when they are searching for your content. It is good practice to identify those common search terms and phrases as you are developing the content and to use them often and consistently in the titles, headings, and text of your content, as well as in the page’s metadata. Avoid using expressions, jargon, metaphors, or puns—in short, any terms that cannot be taken literally.</p>
<p>Many of your users rely on external search engines, such as Google. External search engines try to match users’ search terms with a Web page’s title, headings, and text. By including those search terms in your title, headings, and text, the search engine will be able to take users to the content they are looking for.</p>
<p>To ensure there is no confusion when users are reviewing their search results, use a unique page title and include a concise summary of the content of the page in the page description section of the metadata.</p>

  <p>Years ago, we were watching people try to find products on IKEA.com...Our initial stab had simple tasks. One of them was “Find a bookcase for your living room that can hold 200 books.”...every participant did exactly the same thing. They clicked in the search box on the IKEA home page and typed Bookcases. From here, it was pretty easy to get to the right product.</p>
  <p>In a second round of studies, we changed the task description to something more context-rich, avoiding any clues as to what to type in to the search engine. We ended up with:</p>
  <p>&#8220;You’ve just moved into a new place with a living room that you love because of its expansive walls. Now, you just need someplace to put those 200 prized books that you’ve had in boxes forever. How would you do that?&#8221; </p>
  <p>As we suspected, our participants’ behaviors changed. A couple folks typed bookcase into the search box. Others typed shelves, book shelves, book shelf, and one shelves for books. And others didn’t type anything into the search box, but clicked on the navigation links on the page, including storage systems. Most (but not all) found success using their own strategies.</p>

<p>Content authors must also value the presentation of the information they have created. Appearance affects the usability and credibility of the content. The decoration that supports the content must be visually pleasing and appropriate. If users deem the presentation to be weak or inappropriate, they lose trust.  </p>

<h2 class="margin-top-xlarge"  id="content">Content structure</h2>
<p>You can organize your content by audience, topic, or task, whichever best suits your users. But remember that each user is there to complete a task, so your categories should always lead to a task. However you organize your content, you need to keep the structure simple, logical, and consistent so users can quickly become familiar with it and be able to easily navigate through it.</p>
<h3 id="heading">Headings</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Give each Web page a unique, descriptive title</li>
    <li>Use clear, concise, descriptive, and familiar terms or phrases.</li>
    <li>Use keywords</li>
    <li>Use sub-headings to break up long Web pages</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>The first thing users see on a Web page is the title, so the title must instantly convey the type of information the page contains. The page title must also be unique so users will not confuse one page with another.</p>
<p>Headings should be clear and descriptive to help guide users to the information they are looking for. Including keywords in headings, particularly in the first two words, helps users scan more easily. Subheadings make large blocks of text easier to read and scan. Be sure that subheadings are also clear and concise, and it helps if they are written using <a href="#parallel">parallel structure</a>.</p>
<p>Not only is it a good writing practice to use sub-headings in longer documents, but when information is on the Web, sub-headings improve usability and readability as well.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>As discussed above, there are different approaches to writing for print and writing for Web. This applies to headings as well.</p>
<blockquote class="margin-bottom-large float-right width-90">
  <p>(In) an article in The New York Times about tall people's travails on the road: "Coping With the Tall Traveler's Curse.",...(the) <strong> headline </strong> itself is actually an example of the differences between print and online content style: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> In print, a phrase like "tall traveler's curse" is a bit enticing and   might draw readers in. Because the article featured a photo of a tall   guy crunched in the back of a taxi, the article's content was clear to   anybody glancing at that page in the newspaper. </li>
    <li> In contrast, putting the same headline online would fail several  guidelines for writing for the Web :
      <ul>
        <li> The first 3 words have <strong> no information-carrying content </strong> . On the Web, you must start with words like "tall traveler" because users often  scan down the left part of a list of items. They never see the last words in a link unless the first few words attract their attention. </li>
        <li> The headline <strong> lacks keywords </strong> &#8212; such as "airline seat" and "hotel bed" &#8212; that are important for   search engine optimization (SEO). No one will search "curse" when trying   to find out which hotel chains offer extra-long beds or which airline   seats are the least unpleasant for long-legged travelers. </li>
        <li> The words "tall traveler's curse" are <strong> insufficiently specific </strong> to tell users what the story is about. Because headlines are often   presented as plain links removed from the article itself, the photo of   the poor guy in the cab won't be there to explain the story's content.   Online, the headline alone must provide enough  information scent to let users predict what they'll get if they follow the link. </li>

<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">
  <h4>Key points</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Give the list a descriptive and unique title</li>
    <li>Try to avoid sub-lists</li>
    <li>Arrange the list in a logical order</li>
    <li>Use numbers when listing steps or instructions and bullets for all other lists</li>
    <li>Avoid alphabetizing items</li>
    <li>List the items using a parallel structure</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>Lists are easier to scan than paragraphs, so, where appropriate, use lists instead of paragraphs. However, sub-lists can be confusing and sometimes difficult to scan, so avoid them as much as you can. Each list should have a descriptive and unique heading or an introductory sentence or paragraph to provide some context.</p>
<p>Arrange the items of a list in a logical or sequential order, or by priority, importance, or popularity. If you are listing a series of items where the order is important, you should use numbers rather than bullets. Furthermore, list items with <a href="#parallel">parallel structure</a> to help users scan lists more quickly.</p>
<p>You should generally not alphabetize lists because the user may not be sure which letter their desired information would fall under. Alphabetize lists when the information has a stable naming convention, like people's names or place names.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</h3>
<div class="span-3 float-right module-summary margin-bottom-medium">

    <li>Avoid embedding too many hyperlinks in one paragraph</li>
    <li>Limit hyperlinks to important information</li>
    <li>Verify that the hyperlinks work</li>

<p>Hyperlinks are used to guide users to the information they are looking for. They can also be used to avoid repeating information that is already clearly expressed on another Web page or to reference related information, such as definitions, supporting information, and background information.</p>
<p>Use the title of the target page as the text in the hyperlink; it’s very confusing to users if the link text and page name don’t match. However, sometimes you will need to modify the text; in those cases, attempt to match the text as closely as possible. If you refer to another Web page more than once, only add a hyperlink to the first reference. Also, avoid putting too many hyperlinks in any one paragraph because they can be confusing if they are too close together; users may not be able to tell where one hyperlink ends and the next one begins.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to add a hyperlink to any reference, but you should only add a hyperlink to references that will help users complete their task or that provide valuable information about the task. You should not add a hyperlink to unnecessary or unrelated information because too much blue, underlined text is distracting. It becomes difficult for users to distinguish between important and unimportant hyperlinks. Finally, ensure that the hyperlinks direct users to the right page.

<p>Tables can be an effective way of presenting information; however, they should only be used to display financial, statistical, comparative, or numerical information—not to serve stylistic purposes.</p>
<p>Like text, tables should be clear and concise, with as few data elements as possible in each cell. If you need to include more than a few words in any cell, consider using another format.</p>
<p>If there is not enough white space in each cell, data becomes difficult to read. Ensure that each row and column has a clear and concise heading; this allows screen readers to unambiguously convey the content of the tables. Consider using a visual cue such as an alternating colour scheme to distinguish each row from the next.</p>
